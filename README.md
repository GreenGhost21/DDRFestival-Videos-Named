### These videos require changes in BG Scripts in order to work, including playback speed!

#### Playback speed of nearly every, if not every, video is 25 frames per second.

##### Changes (aside from playback speed) are as follows, in no apparent order:

- beware's `fusion1` and `fusion2` are split into their components, titled as fusion1 to fusion4. The combinations of these to equal beware's are:
>- fusion1.avi: ``` fusion1.mkv fusion4.mkv ```
>- fusion2.avi: ``` fusion1.mkv fusion2.mkv fusion2.mkv fusion3.mkv ```
>- Yes, there is supposed to be 2 `fusion2.mkv` in there.

- `ninja3.mkv` is a trimmed `ninja2.mkv`
