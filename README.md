### These videos require changes in BG Scripts in order to work, including playback speed!

#### Playback speed of nearly every, if not every, video is 25 frames per second.

##### Changes (aside from playback speed) are as follows, in no apparent order:

- beware's `fusion1` and `fusion2` are split into their components, titled as fusion1 to fusion4. The combinations of these to equal beware's are:
>- fusion1.avi: ``` fusion1.mkv fusion4.mkv ```
>- fusion2.avi: ``` fusion1.mkv fusion2.mkv fusion2.mkv fusion3.mkv ```
>- Yes, there is supposed to be 2 `fusion2.mkv` in there.

- beware's `smash1` is split into two videos, titled `smash1.mkv` and `smash2.mkv`.

- `ninja3.mkv` is a trimmed `ninja2.mkv`

- beware's `ninja1` is actually composed of several different "ninja" videos. The combination of videos that equal beware's `ninja1` are:
>- ```ninja1c.mkv ninja1b.mkv smash1.mkv ninja1a.mkv```
